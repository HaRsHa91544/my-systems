    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Your(You) Goal: Make your Team or Employees to CARE about Our End Customers.</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">The Big Question, How it is Possible?</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Make Leaders in your Team and Pass your DNA to them and by them to the next layer of Employees. How?</h3>
    <h3>Before going to know about it. Let's know who the Leader is?</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>A Leader should decrease the Coordination Costs of a Team (Extra effort to align a Team).</h2>
    <img src="img/coordination-1.png" alt="" width="700">
    <img src="img/coordination-2.png" alt="" width="700">
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">A Leader should generate the <b>Current</b> to increase the Coordination in a Team.
        Through Excitement, Incentive, Inspiration and Fear, etc.</h3>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Generating Current in <b>Morning</b> when you Wakeup will have more Impact on you
        and your
        Team.</h3>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">A Best Leader always generate <b>INFINITE</b> Current without any Burnout.</h3>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">The World always tries to Drag you Down but you should get the Current Back to you.
    </h3>
    <h2>Always push your Team to Bet on Impossible Things even they are small and have them Freedom to Fail.</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>The Units to Generate Current are: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Stories</li>
        <li>Incentives</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Stories and Incentives (not only money) should be Personalized they need to align to your Team
        Members.<br>Ex: Working only on 4 Days per Week, Free Cafeteria
        and Lounge, Work from Home, etc.</h2>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Try Incentives on you also, it works even for you.</h3>
    <h2>So, you must be as much as close you can with your Team Members and know their Aspirations, Needs or Goals.</h2>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Cash is the Least Powerful Incentive:
        <ul>
            <li>Respect</li>
            <li>Status</li>
            <li>Purpose</li>
            <li>Roadmap to
                Master in their Role</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Assign the Team Targets for Long Time and show the clear Progress of the Team to make them feel Confident and
        Productive.</h2>
    <br>
    <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">You can bring down the Threshold of Coordination, How?</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="img/coordination-3.png" alt="" width="700">
    <br>
    <h2>By Providing Clear Instructions to Teams. Any Person in the Team can Work Better if you give Clear Instructions
        to them.
    </h2>
    <h2>So, if you are a Good Leader you must have OWNERSHIP to write down Instructions clearly for your Teams.</h2>
    <h2>Also, the Best Leaders feel Easier to Teach - How to Generate Current.</h2>
    <br>
    <img src="img/coordination-4.png" alt="" width="700">
    <h2>You must always and always Enforce Rules, if you Leave it. <br> Everyone feels it's ok to avoid the Rules and
        you Lose your Story Telling Power.</h2>
    <img src="img/coordination-5.png" alt="" width="700">
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Every Company, Religion, Community and Organisation whatever has these FOUR PILLARS
        in their System.</h3>
    <br>
    <h2>Another Big Question is Why do we even need this Closed System?</h2>
    <h3 style="font-weight: normal;">Simple, A Closed Coordinated System can CRUSH the Uncoordinated System in the
        Company and focuses purely on Growth.</h3>
    <h2>But, the Truth is No System or a Person can Coordinate the Team 100%. There are no metrics to Measure, it can be
        Observed by Intuition.</h2>
